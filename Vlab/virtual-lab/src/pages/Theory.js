      <p>   
        The Node.js `events` module is used to handle asynchronous events in a Node.js application. It provides an interface for handling event-driven programming by allowing us to define custom events, listen to those events, and execute code when they occur.
      </p>
      <ol className="theory-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Introduction to Node.js Events Module:</strong>
          <span> The `events` module allows you to create and handle custom events in Node.js using the `EventEmitter` class. It is a powerful feature for building event-driven, asynchronous applications.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Creating and Emitting Events:</strong>
          <span> Use the `EventEmitter` class to create a new event and use the `emit()` method to trigger it. This allows you to define custom events that can execute specific code when emitted.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Listening for Events:</strong>
          <span> The `on()` method is used to listen for events. When an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it are called. You can also use `once()` to listen for an event only once.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Error Handling with Events:</strong>
          <span> Events often need error handling. The `events` module allows custom error events, which help in managing errors asynchronously. If an error event is emitted without a listener, Node.js throws an error by default.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Removing Event Listeners:</strong>
          <span> The `removeListener()` and `removeAllListeners()` methods allow you to manage memory and resources by detaching listeners from events when they are no longer needed.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Example Use Cases:</strong>
          <span> Events are useful for applications that involve real-time data, logging, or notifications. For example, you can emit a `notification` event each time a user logs in or a `log` event to store system logs asynchronously.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Counting Listeners:</strong>
          <span> Use `listenerCount()` to check the number of listeners for a particular event, which is useful for debugging and managing event handling more efficiently.</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Understanding the `events` module allows developers to implement asynchronous workflows by reacting to specific application events. This approach can simplify complex application logic and provide better resource management, especially in large-scale Node.js applications.
